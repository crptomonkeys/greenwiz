# greenwiz
The Green Wizard is a discord NFT tipbot launched in 2019, and is the first ever NFT tipbot on any chat platform. It was custom built specifically for cryptomonKeys, and has given out more than 50,000 free NFTs to date. It also has advanced auto-moderation capabilities, and has automatically banned tens of thousands of spammers/scammers.
